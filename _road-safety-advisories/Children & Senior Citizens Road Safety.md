### Children & Senior Citizens Road Safety
------------------------------------------

Children and the elderly are among the most vulnerable groups among road users, with elderly people counting for almost half of all pedestrian deaths. Road safety for children is a major social concern. Just remember though that safety is not an accident – it’s a choice each of us can make. Follow traffic rules and remember these road safety tips for children and the elderly:

### RULES TO ENHANCE ROAD SAFETY FOR CHILDREN:
------------------------------------------

**Always Do’s:**

*   Always cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings, overhead bridges, underpasses or zebra crossings.
*   Always be alert for inattentive drivers even at signalized crossings.
*   Always use footpaths when possible.
*   Always hold on to handrails on the bus to avoid being thrown off balance during sudden swerves or brakes.
*   Always wait for the bus to stop fully before boarding or alighting.
*   Always be alert for any oncoming cyclists or pedestrians when alighting from the bus.

**Never Do’s:**

*   Never sprint across roads.
*   Never cross in front of a stationary vehicle or between stationary vehicles.
*   Never cross when the “red man” lights up or when the “green man” is flashing.
*   Never play nor stand in the bus bay.
*   Never play in a moving vehicle.

### TIPS FOR PARENTS:
-----------------

*   Be patient when driving your child to school, these are peak traffic hours.
*   Always park your vehicle at designated parking areas.
*   Be alert and anticipate any crossings by school children.
*   Teach your children about road safety rules. Set a good example.
*   Help your child to cross the road safely.

### ROAD SAFETY TIPS FOR THE ELDERLY
--------------------------------

Accidents involving the elderly frequently happen because of their diminished sensory and motor skills. But this doesn’t mean that senior citizens cannot enjoy the use of our roads. Help the elderly to enhance their safety by getting them to follow these road safety tips:

*   RAISING YOUR HAND WHILE CROSSING a road is a good way to alert motorists.
*   BE ALERT FOR INATTENTIVE DRIVERS, even when you are walking across allotted pedestrian crossing areas.
*   Always remember to WALK ON FOOTPATHS AND WALKWAYS.
*   USE PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS like overhead bridges, underpasses, zebra crossings, and signalized traffic lights.
*   BE SEEN, BE SAFE. Wear light coloured clothing or carry some reflective material when you’re walking at night.
*   GET ASSISTANCE from someone if you’re going out. Don’t stand too far out when waiting for a bus or taxi.
*   NEVER CROSS AT ROAD BENDS, where you cannot see oncoming vehicles and where they cannot see you. Cross from an area where you have a full view of both sides of the road.
*   DON’T CROSS BETWEEN STATIONARY VEHICLES as these could move forward and run you over.
