### Cyclists Road Safety
====================

Pedal cyclists, due to their small size, are among the most vulnerable road users. To enhance their safety on the road, cyclists must obey all traffic rules and regulations. Many cyclists’ accidents can also be prevented if they use the proper safety gear.

### SAFETY TIPS FOR CYCLISTS
------------------------

*   Protect your head from injury by wearing a safety helmet.
*   Use elbow pads and knee pads to cushion the impact of a fall.
*   Wear proper shoes, and make sure that the laces are always tied properly.
*   Do not wear bell bottom and baggy pants, as this could get entangled with the pedals and other moving parts.

### TIPS WHEN LEARNING TO RIDE
--------------------------

*   Ride a bicycle that fits you properly.
*   Lean your upper body slightly forward when you are holding the handlebar.
*   Both feet must be able to touch the ground. For beginners, the whole foot must be able to be planted flat on the ground; the heels should be able to touch the ground.

### REMEMBER THESE WHEN USING THE ROAD:
-----------------------------------

*   Act as if you’re a pedestrian – look right, left, and then right again. When the road is clear, push your bicycle across for better safety.
*   Use hand signals to warn other road users when you stop. Place the left foot on the ground and alight from the left side of the road.
*   Be extra alert at road junctions – these are accident-prone areas.
*   Stop your bicycle completely at “Give Way” and “Stop” signs.
*   Before crossing at junctions with traffic lights, always look to see if there are no vehicles coming from the left and right.
*   DO NOT carry a pillion rider.
*   DO NOT ride in a zigzag manner.
*   DO NOT carry things, walk a dog, hold an umbrella, or otherwise occupy one hand while cycling.
*   DO NOT risk injuries by doing dangerous stunts.

### GUARD AGAINST THESE COMMON MISTAKES:
------------------------------------

*   Failing to keep to the edge of the road
*   Failing to look out properly for traffic
*   Failing to give hand signals
*   Failing to wear light-coloured clothing or reflective gear at night
*   Failing to keep bicycle well-maintained
*   Swerving in and out of traffic
*   Disobeying traffic signals

### MAINTENANCE CHECK FOR BICYCLES:
-------------------------------

Always check for mechanical faults

*   Handlebar must be tight and adjusted properly
*   Seat must be adjusted to proper height, with the feet being able to touch the ground
*   Brakes should work perfectly
*   Tyres must be properly inflated
*   Lights and reflectors must be working and placed at proper positions
*   Bicycle bell or horn must be working
*   Mudguards should be fitted properly
