Motorcyclists Road Safety
=========================

There is great concern for the safety of motorcyclists in our roads. Among all users, motorcycle and pillion riders comprise the largest group that is involved in fatal road accidents. Road safety for motorcyclists is a paramount concern, as motorcycle riding requires balancing skills and greater control as compared to car driving. A motorcycle is also less visible and can be easily missed on the road. Furthermore, the body of the motorcycle offers very little protection to the motorcyclist.

Here are important reminders to reduce the risks in motorcycling:
