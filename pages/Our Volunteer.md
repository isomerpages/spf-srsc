The ‘Friends of SRSC’ – launched in May 2022 in conjunction with the Singapore Road Safety Month (SRSM) – is a platform set up to recruit like-minded individuals to become SRSC’s eyes and ears, and ambassadors to widen SRSC’s Road Safety outreach efforts.

Road Safety messages and advisories were shared to these ‘Friends’ through the ‘Friends of SRSC’ Telegram Channel and SRSC’s Facebook page where they can assist to widen the outreach by spreading the messages to their friends and loved ones, as well as reshare on their own Social Media platforms. The ‘Friends of SRSC’ can volunteer at their own time and convenience and can volunteer for both short and long term.

Some of the duties of these volunteers includes:

*   Assisting to spread Road Safety Messages and Advisories
*   Assisting to generate awareness for SRSC’s outreach campaigns and fundraising efforts
*   Alert the Secretariat on the latest news on Road Safety and relevant focus points for upcoming campaigns
*   To be SRSC’s advocates in recruiting and expanding the pool of Activists

*   To help out in SRSC’s physical campaigns e.g. logistics, engagements, recruitments, ushers, distribution of goodie bags / pamphlets etc.
