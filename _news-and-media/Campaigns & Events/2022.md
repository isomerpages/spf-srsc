The Traffic Police (TP), together with the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), held the Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2022 (ADD2022) on 22 December 2022 at Ten Square, Landmark of Good. Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State (MOS), Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.

“Drink or Drive, You Decide”, is the choice that presents itself to motorists as they enjoy the festivities. Motorists must make the wise decision to pick only one of the two options, and be mindful of the adverse consequences of drink-driving.

As part of the campaign, MOS Faishal unveiled a visual with the tagline 'Drink or Drive, You Decide’, to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink. Instead, they should use alternative forms of transport, engage the services of a valet, or have another designated driver among their friends and family, who will remain sober, to send them home. The visual illustrates the dangers of driving when impaired by alcohol. A moment of folly could quickly lead to tragedy, which in turn impacts family, friends, and the community. 

 To further reinforce the anti-drink drive message and remind motorists of the dangers of drink-driving, posters and banners carrying this visual will also be displayed as at Police Notice Boards located at HDB lift landings and void decks island-wide, as well as at nightspots, drinking establishments and coffee shops.

The Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council, supported by the Ministry of Education, Bukit Batok Driving Centre, ComfortDelgro Driving Centre and Singapore Safety Driving Centre, held the grand finals of the Singapore Traffic Games (STG) on Wednesday, 9 November 2022, at the Road Safety Community Park. Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Transport Government Parliamentary Committee, Mr Saktiandi Bin Supaat, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour (GOH).

The Singapore Traffic Games have come a long way as a valuable platform to raise road safety awareness among primary school children, who are educated on road safety knowledge and application of road safety practices through various fun traffic games and engaging hands-on training sessions.

The Singapore Traffic Games return to the Road Safety Community Park in July this year after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 20 primary schools competed in the STG qualifying rounds, with the top 10 primary schools progressing on to the grand finals on 9 November 2022. Yumin Primary School emerged as the champion with the lowest number of accumulated demerit points, and was awarded the STG Challenge Trophy.

The other highlight for this year’s STG was the launch of the “Road Safety Challenge!”, an online programme hosted on the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS). Since its launch in July this year, there was overwhelming response from the schools. A special award was given to the top 10 schools with the most number of student participations in the “Road Safety Challenge!”, as a recognition of their strong support for the programme.

During the event, the G-O-H unveiled a specially designed e-poster and banner on pedestrian safety as part of TP’s ongoing outreach efforts to remind children on the importance of road safety. This visual will be disseminated to both local and international primary schools for their outreach programme.

Road safety is a shared responsibility. It is important to continue educating our young road users and instil good road safety habits early.

SRS 2022 was held in conjunction with National Bikers Weekend (NBW) 2022 at D’Marquee on 5 November 2022. The guest-of-honour was Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling. About 150 guests from the local motorcycle interest groups, partners and stakeholders attended the event.

To highlight the importance of wearing proper protective gears while riding, demonstrations on how wearing protective riding gear can be both fashionable and functionable were shown through a fashion show. Mr Kamsani, a driving school instructor from ComfortDelgro Driving Centre, also delivered a defensive riding talk to give helpful tips on riding safely in challenging traffic situations to reduce the risk of traffic accidents.

TP and SRSC hope that the SRS 2022 Campaign will promote safer riding habits among motorcyclists.

The star-studded concert featured performances by renowned local artistes, such as Marcus Chin (陈建彬), Kelvin Soon (孙文海), Cola Lau (阳光可乐), Asmiyati Binti Asbah (Yati) and Poobalan s/o Morgan (Balan).

The event also featured two sharing sessions relevant to road safety for seniors.  One was by TP’s road safety champion , Yeow Seng Yong(邱胜扬), who shared some useful road safety tips for seniors.  The other was by Ken Tong, the President of the Optometric Association, who shared the importance of eye care for pedestrians and drivers in a talk tilted “An eye opener to your health”.

Road safety is a shared responsibility. The dangers of jaywalking should not be underestimated.  Seniors are encouraged to always use pedestrian crossings or overhead bridges when crossing the roads.
