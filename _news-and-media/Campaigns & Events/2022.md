The Traffic Police (TP), together with the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), held the Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2022 (ADD2022) on 22 December 2022 at Ten Square, Landmark of Good. Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State (MOS), Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.

“Drink or Drive, You Decide”, is the choice that presents itself to motorists as they enjoy the festivities. Motorists must make the wise decision to pick only one of the two options, and be mindful of the adverse consequences of drink-driving.

As part of the campaign, MOS Faishal unveiled a visual with the tagline 'Drink or Drive, You Decide’, to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink. Instead, they should use alternative forms of transport, engage the services of a valet, or have another designated driver among their friends and family, who will remain sober, to send them home. The visual illustrates the dangers of driving when impaired by alcohol. A moment of folly could quickly lead to tragedy, which in turn impacts family, friends, and the community. 

 To further reinforce the anti-drink drive message and remind motorists of the dangers of drink-driving, posters and banners carrying this visual will also be displayed as at Police Notice Boards located at HDB lift landings and void decks island-wide, as well as at nightspots, drinking establishments and coffee shops.

The Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council, supported by the Ministry of Education, Bukit Batok Driving Centre, ComfortDelgro Driving Centre and Singapore Safety Driving Centre, held the grand finals of the Singapore Traffic Games (STG) on Wednesday, 9 November 2022, at the Road Safety Community Park. Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Transport Government Parliamentary Committee, Mr Saktiandi Bin Supaat, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour (GOH).

The Singapore Traffic Games have come a long way as a valuable platform to raise road safety awareness among primary school children, who are educated on road safety knowledge and application of road safety practices through various fun traffic games and engaging hands-on training sessions.

The Singapore Traffic Games return to the Road Safety Community Park in July this year after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 20 primary schools competed in the STG qualifying rounds, with the top 10 primary schools progressing on to the grand finals on 9 November 2022. Yumin Primary School emerged as the champion with the lowest number of accumulated demerit points, and was awarded the STG Challenge Trophy.

The other highlight for this year’s STG was the launch of the “Road Safety Challenge!”, an online programme hosted on the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS). Since its launch in July this year, there was overwhelming response from the schools. A special award was given to the top 10 schools with the most number of student participations in the “Road Safety Challenge!”, as a recognition of their strong support for the programme.

During the event, the G-O-H unveiled a specially designed e-poster and banner on pedestrian safety as part of TP’s ongoing outreach efforts to remind children on the importance of road safety. This visual will be disseminated to both local and international primary schools for their outreach programme.

Road safety is a shared responsibility. It is important to continue educating our young road users and instil good road safety habits early.
