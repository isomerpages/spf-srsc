### 40th Shell Traffic Games 2021

The Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) organised the closing ceremony of the 40th Shell Traffic Games on Tuesday, 21 December 2021 at the Road Safety Community Park. The event was supported by the Shell Companies in Singapore. The Guest-of-Honour was Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris – Punggol GRC.

The Shell Traffic Games is an annual inter-school event where primary school children learn road safety rules in the form of a fun and interactive race either as a pedestrian, cyclist, or motorist in a go-kart. Over the years, the Games have evolved with the adoption of technology to promote interactivity during road safety training. In 2017, TP introduced the Shell Traffic Games mobile application to replace hardcopy route cards of the Road Safety Community Park. It was a significant step towards digitalisation, as students who attended road safety training at the park could use their mobile phones to help them navigate their way around the park. Virtual Reality (VR) goggles were also adopted for road safety training in 2018. The VR goggles allowed students to learn about traffic rules through visual simulations of a traffic environment.

Due to the COVID-19 restrictions this year, the Traffic Police, the Singapore Road Safety Council, and the Shell Companies in Singapore, have collaborated with the Ministry of Education to organise a video competition.

The video competition was opened to all primary school children, and the competition encouraged children to think about what road safety meant to them. The videos were judged on creativity, originality, content, and visuals.

TP and SRSC have also produced a special commemorative medallion to commemorate the Shell Traffic Games. The medallion will be presented to our partners who have made this initiative a resounding success for the past 40 years.

Road safety is everyone’s responsibility. It is important to educate our young road users to instil good road safety habits early.

### Anti-Drink Drive (ADD) 2021
![](/images/20211210_antidrindrive_campaign_2021_drink_or_drive_you_decide_4.jpg)

The Traffic Police (TP), together with the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), organised the Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2021 (ADD2021), which was launched on Thursday, 9 December 2021, at the Traffic Police’s Heritage Hall. Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Sustainability &amp; the Environment, graced the event as the Guest of Honour. The event was livestreamed on the Use Your RoadSense Facebook page.

ADD2021 serves as a timely reminder for motorists not to drink and drive especially during the festive period. It also aims to raise awareness on the ills of drink-driving and to encourage road users to be responsible.

The tagline for this year’s campaign is ‘_Drink or Drive, You Decide_’, to encourage motorists not to drive if they intend to drink. As such, this tagline serves to remind motorists that they should make a choice between drinking or driving. If they choose to drink, then they should not drive, and should resort to getting home using public transport, engaging the services of a valet, or getting a friend or family member who is sober, to drive them home.

As part of the campaign, TP produced a Road Safety video titled “_What really happens when you are caught for drink-drinking?_” to give motorists an insight on what happens if they are caught for drink-driving. This video features Traffic Police officers demonstrating how they deal with an offender caught for drink-driving. The officers also shared the common things they experienced from a drink-driving case during their duty.

In addition, a Road Safety Poster with the campaign tagline was produced and will be distributed to stakeholders and community partners for them to display at their premises to drive home the important message of not drinking and driving.

As the festive season is just around the corner, TP would like to remind motorists to practise good RoadSense, be gracious, and never drink and drive. Get home safely to your loved ones.

### Singapore Ride Safe 2021

On Friday, 29 October 2021 the Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) launched the Singapore Ride Safe 2021 campaign together with Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.

This year’s campaign tagline ‘’Gear Up, Ride Safe’’ is intended to remind motorcyclists to don protective riding gears such as approved helmet, riding jacket, gloves and boots.

SRSC and TP hope the launch of the Singapore Ride Safe 2021 campaign will serve as a timely reminder for all motorcyclists to ride safely and responsibly so as to keep themselves and other road users safe.

### "Road Safety For Seniors 2021" Campaign


 The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Lions Befrienders, launched the Road Safety for Seniors 2021 campaign on 16 July 2021.

Accidents involving elderly pedestrians remain a key concern as about half of the fatal accidents involving elderly pedestrians were due to jaywalking. Constant reminders are therefore necessary to encourage seniors to always use pedestrian crossings.

As part of the campaign, an online road safety programme was held for 33 seniors of the Lions Befrienders across nine Senior Activity Centres on 16 July 2021. The programme included a road safety talk by Mr Yeow Seng Yong, a MediaCorp Senior Producer-Presenter, who is also an Honorary Assistant Superintendent of Police with the Volunteer Special Constabulary. He reminded seniors to practise good road safety habits while using the roads. This was followed by a road safety skit and a sharing session on eye care for seniors by Mr Ken Tong, Chairman of the Singapore Optometric Association. The programme was recorded and will subsequently be shared on SRSC’s Facebook and YouTube pages.

In collaboration with Sheng Siong Supermarket, road safety advisories were displayed in their major supermarkets to remind shoppers to cross the roads responsibly by looking out for traffic before crossing the road. Road Safety banners will also be put up at strategic locations to encourage and remind seniors to cross the road safely by using pedestrian crossings.

SRSC and TP will continue to educate and remind seniors to use the roads safely for the well-being of themselves and their families.

### Singapore Road Safety Month (SRSM) 2021

The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority, Ministry of Education, People’s Association and Automobile Association of Singapore, launched the Singapore Road Safety Month 2021 campaign on Friday, 28 May 2021.

The theme of the month-long campaign is “Road Safety for All”. The campaign will focus on raising awareness on red light running and speeding offences. The Guest of Honour for the online launch of the campaign was Associate Professor Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State for the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development.

Two road safety videos were produced as part of public education outreach efforts to educate motorists on the correct driving behaviours. The videos highlight the seriousness and negative consequences of red light running and speeding, and what must be done to avoid these accidents arising from the offences. The videos will be aired on various SRSC social media platforms including Facebook and YouTube as well as on national television.

To raise awareness on the importance of safe driving and looking out for other motorists on the road, a month-long ‘Spot the Safe Motorist’ programme, was also organised as part of Singapore Road Safety Month 2021. From 28 May 2021 to 27 June 2021, motorists who are spotted by TP patrol officers displaying safe driving behaviour or performing a courteous act on the roads, were rewarded with a COVID-19 care pack.

We would like to remind the public to stay safe on the roads and to remain safe during the COVID-19 situation.
