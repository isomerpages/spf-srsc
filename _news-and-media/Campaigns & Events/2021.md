Anti-Drink Drive (ADD) 2021
==================

The Traffic Police (TP), together with the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), organised the Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2021 (ADD2021), which was launched on Thursday, 9 December 2021, at the Traffic Police’s Heritage Hall. Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Sustainability & the Environment, graced the event as the Guest of Honour. The event was livestreamed on the Use Your RoadSense Facebook page.

ADD2021 serves as a timely reminder for motorists not to drink and drive especially during the festive period. It also aims to raise awareness on the ills of drink-driving and to encourage road users to be responsible.

The tagline for this year’s campaign is ‘_Drink or Drive, You Decide_’, to encourage motorists not to drive if they intend to drink. As such, this tagline serves to remind motorists that they should make a choice between drinking or driving. If they choose to drink, then they should not drive, and should resort to getting home using public transport, engaging the services of a valet, or getting a friend or family member who is sober, to drive them home.

As part of the campaign, TP produced a Road Safety video titled “_What really happens when you are caught for drink-drinking?_” to give motorists an insight on what happens if they are caught for drink-driving. This video features Traffic Police officers demonstrating how they deal with an offender caught for drink-driving. The officers also shared the common things they experienced from a drink-driving case during their duty.

In addition, a Road Safety Poster with the campaign tagline was produced and will be distributed to stakeholders and community partners for them to display at their premises to drive home the important message of not drinking and driving.

As the festive season is just around the corner, TP would like to remind motorists to practise good RoadSense, be gracious, and never drink and drive. Get home safely to your loved ones.

Road Safety For Seniors 2021 Campaign
==================

 The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Lions Befrienders, launched the Road Safety for Seniors 2021 campaign on 16 July 2021.

Accidents involving elderly pedestrians remain a key concern as about half of the fatal accidents involving elderly pedestrians were due to jaywalking. Constant reminders are therefore necessary to encourage seniors to always use pedestrian crossings.

As part of the campaign, an online road safety programme was held for 33 seniors of the Lions Befrienders across nine Senior Activity Centres on 16 July 2021. The programme included a road safety talk by Mr Yeow Seng Yong, a MediaCorp Senior Producer-Presenter, who is also an Honorary Assistant Superintendent of Police with the Volunteer Special Constabulary. He reminded seniors to practise good road safety habits while using the roads. This was followed by a road safety skit and a sharing session on eye care for seniors by Mr Ken Tong, Chairman of the Singapore Optometric Association. The programme was recorded and will subsequently be shared on SRSC’s Facebook and YouTube pages.

In collaboration with Sheng Siong Supermarket, road safety advisories were displayed in their major supermarkets to remind shoppers to cross the roads responsibly by looking out for traffic before crossing the road. Road Safety banners will also be put up at strategic locations to encourage and remind seniors to cross the road safely by using pedestrian crossings.

SRSC and TP will continue to educate and remind seniors to use the roads safely for the well-being of themselves and their families.
