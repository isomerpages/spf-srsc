The annual campaign aims to remind motorists to prioritise safety by refraining from driving after consuming alcohol. MOS Faishal was the Guest-of-Honour at this year’s event, where he unveiled a visual bearing the campaign tagline, “Make the Right Choice: Don’t Drink and Drive”. The tagline will be featured on various collaterals such as posters, car decals and coasters, which will be distributed across nightspots, drinking establishments and coffee shops. The Chairman of Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association, and the President of Singapore Nightlife Business Association also attended the event.

As part of the campaign, TP also collaborated with the Land Transport Authority to display anti-drink drive messages on electronic boards positioned along the expressways and main roads to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink.  

Drink-driving is an irresponsible act, posing significant risks to motorists and other road users. TP has consistently observed instances where motorists underestimate the detrimental effects of alcohol or overestimate their alcohol tolerance level, leading to accidents and loss of lives. 

For the safety of all road users, motorists should refrain from driving to the venue if they intend to consume alcohol. Instead, they should opt for alternative forms of transport, such as taking a taxi or private hire vehicle, public transport, engaging the services of a valet, or designating a sober friend or family member to send them home.

### SRSC Fundraising Gala Dinner 2023

The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) held its annual fundraising gala dinner on 17 November 2023. The dinner seeks to raise funds for road safety education programmes in Singapore.  
  
Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development attended the event as the Guest-of-Honour. SRSC successfully raised more than $500,000 from corporates and individuals, inclusive of the Dollar-for-Dollar matching grant by Tote Board.  
  
Public education on road safety is a continuous effort and SRSC works closely with road safety stakeholders to identify trends of concern. Based on the Mid-Year Traffic Situation 2023 reported by Traffic Police (TP), there are two main areas of concern:

i. Traffic accidents in the first half of 2023 had increased, compared to the same period in 2022; and

ii.  Accidents involving vulnerable road users, such as elderly pedestrians and motorcyclists, remain a key concern, as they accounted for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities

Associate Professor Faishal said “To address these trends, public education and partnerships remain our key strategy. TP collaborated with the SRSC to organise several events this year. Beyond public education, road users must exercise personal responsibility, and practise safe driving and riding habits.”

He also presented the Singapore Road Safety Awards 2023, Excellence Awards for Companies, and Safe Drivers Awards. The awards recognised the conscientious efforts of industry players who implemented safety measures to ensure their vehicle fleet and drivers are safe on the roads. The Safe Drivers Awards acknowledged vocational drivers who demonstrated personal responsibility to ensure their safety and the safety of others while they work.

This year, the road safety storybook for children – Road Safety with Kay and Bear Bear – was launched. The book was produced to complement SRSC and TP’s efforts to increase road safety awareness amongst children and features road safety tips for children through vibrant illustrations. This includes messages that everyone should always abide by traffic rules and be gracious on the road. These storybooks would be distributed to every preschool and library in Singapore.

The journey towards accident-free roads requires the effort of every road user. Regardless of age, everyone can play their part by looking out for their own safety and that of other road users.

On Friday, 13 October 2023, in conjunction with the National Bikers’ Weekend (NBW) 2023, the Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), with the support of Land Transport Authority (LTA) launched the Singapore Ride Safe (SRS) 2023 campaign at D’ Marquee Downtown East. Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of National Development graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour. 

Motorcyclists continue to be over-represented in road traffic accidents. Between January and June 2023, motorcyclists and pillion riders were involved in 51.8% of all traffic accidents. They made up 45.1% of all traffic fatalities.

The SRS 2023 campaign is part of TP’s ongoing efforts to engage the motorcyclist community. It comprised two segments:

Reward the Riders 2023 

1 June to 30 September 2023 – “Rewards the Riders” RTR 2023

TP continued with the “Reward the Riders” (RTR) initiative in 2023. Motorcyclists who were spotted by TP patrol officers wearing appropriate safety gear and/or displaying safe riding habits on the roads, were rewarded with goodie bags and featured on the “Use Your RoadSense” Facebook page. Past RTR campaigns were well received by the motorcycling community and members of the public. Online RTR posts of the rewarded motorcyclists on the “Use Your RoadSense” Facebook page, which also contained reminders to motorcyclists to don appropriate riding gear and practise safe riding habits, attracted more than 660,000 views. Since its inception in 2019, TP has rewarded more than 700 exemplary riders.  
  
From June to September 2023, a total of 72 riders were commended by TP. Amongst the 72, five exemplary riders with good riding records were given a special award during SRS 2023.

Singapore Ride Safe 2023 Campaign at D’ Marquee Downtown East  

13 to 15 October 2023, SRS 2023 at the NBW, D’ Marquee Downtown East

SRS 2023 aims to continue promoting safe riding behaviours among motorcyclists. From 13 to 15 October 2023, in collaboration with the NBW and SRSC, TP will set up an exhibition titled “The Last Ride” specially curated for motorcyclists and other motorists. This exhibition, which showcases the aftermath of an accident involving motorcyclists and pillion riders, is a stark reminder of the grave consequences of errant and reckless road users. A new visual titled “Ride SAFE” was also launched by MOS Faishal on 13 October 2023 with four desired riding behaviours and the visual would be incorporated into collaterals for use in TP’s engagements.

TP and SRSC hope that the SRS 2023 campaign will enhance the safety awareness of the motorcyclists and encourage them to adopt a safer riding behaviour.

A Road Safety Concert for Seniors was held at the Ci Yuan Auditorium on 19 August 2023 to reach out to elderly pedestrians. The event was attended by about 400 senior citizens and was graced by Guest-of-Honour Mr Bernard Tay, who is also Chairman Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC),

During the event, Traffic Police (TP) and SRSC gave out LED wristbands as special collaterals for elderly pedestrians. The LED wristbands will help to enhance the visibility of the wearer to oncoming vehicles, especially in the early morning or at night, when it is dark.


Elderly pedestrians are a vulnerable group of road users. In 2022, there were 235 accidents involving elderly pedestrians. Twenty-three of them lost their lives. About 75% of the accidents were attributed to jaywalking.Through entertaining songs and a skit by local artistes such as Lee Pei Fen (李佩芬), Aven Cheng (皓皓), Rawi Hamin (Rawi), Asmiyati Binti Asbah (Yati), Poobalan s/o Morgan (Balan), Anna Lim Ru Ping (林茹萍)，Xu Qiong Fang (许琼芳), and Zhu Li Li (朱丽丽), these performances aimed to raise senior citizens’ awareness of the dangers of jaywalking and encouraged the use of pedestrian crossings. 

The concert was also live-streamed via various social media platforms such as TP’s ‘Use Your RoadSense’ Facebook page, and the artistes’ social media pages, which garnered about 16,700 viewers online. 

This event was organised by TP and the SRSC, with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and People’s Association (PA), as part of ongoing engagement and educational efforts to raise road safety awareness, and to inculcate good road etiquette among the elderly.![](/images/_DSC5729.JPG)

One of the highlights of this year’s campaign is the two-day ‘Road Safety for All’ carnival at Toa Payoh Hub Mall Atrium from 1 – 2 July 2023. This is the first time SRSC has organised a physical carnival since the resumption of public events since the COVID-19 pandemic. The carnival features informative road safety exhibition displays and interactive activities.

This year, one of the booth partners, SBS Transit, has organised an activity for members of the public to sit in a physical bus to experience a bus driver’s field of vision and understand their blind spots when driving. This enables road users to more effectively avoid being in the blind spots of bus drivers for their safety. SBS Transit has also highlighted safe commuting habits with its "Flag the Bus Early" campaign for road and commuter safety.
