The Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2020 was launched virtually on 23 December 2020 by the Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC). Associate Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, was the guest of honour.

The campaign is part of TP’s outreach efforts during the festive season to remind motorists that drink-driving is irresponsible and put themselves and other road users in danger. This year’s campaign tagline, “Drink or Drive, You Decide”, aims to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink.

As part of the campaign efforts, a short animation video will be uploaded on the Use Your RoadSense Facebook page on 24 December 2020. Road Safety leaflets and face masks with the tagline printed on it, will be distributed to motorists.

In collaboration with the Land Transport Authority, the campaign messages will also be displayed on the electronic boards along expressways and major roads, to remind motorists not to drink and drive.

Drink-driving is a serious offence. While the number of drink-driving cases has decreased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period last year, the number of drink-driving accidents resulting in fatalities has increased. TP will continue to take tough enforcement actions against motorists who choose to drink and drive. Road safety is a shared responsibility, we should remind our friends and family to leave their vehicles at home if they intend to drink. TP urges all motorists to play their part and adopt good road sense to make Singapore roads safer for everyone.

### Singapore Ride Safe (SRS) 2020

The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and the Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), launched the Singapore Ride Safe 2020 on 23 October 2020.

Accidents involving motorcyclists remain a key concern as they continue to account for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting in injuries or death. In the first half of 2020, motorcyclists or pillion riders were involved in about 60% of overall traffic accidents, and made up about 60% of overall traffic fatalities.

This year, a road safety video titled, ‘Be Safe For Your Loved Ones’, has been produced to remind motorcyclists to ride safely so that they can return home safely to their loved ones. The video, which was uploaded on SRSC’s Facebook, YouTube and Instagram on 23 October 2020, aims to encourage motorcyclists to don protective riding gear, stay out of blind spots of larger vehicles, and slow down as they approach, and while manoeuvring at road bends or corners.

The “Reward the Rider” initiative was also introduced in conjunction with Singapore Ride Safe 2020 on 23 October 2020 for a period of one month. Motorcyclists who are spotted by TP patrol officers wearing protective riding gear and practising good road sense and riding behaviour, were rewarded with road safety collaterals.

To widen outreach efforts, road safety tips for motorcyclists will also be shared over the air through radio station GOLD 90.5FM during the morning programme, LIVE! With Mike, Vernetta &amp; Gurmit, from Monday, 26 October 2020 to Saturday, 31 October 2020. Audiences who take part in the contests and games during the programme, won prizes sponsored by Harley Davidson.

SRSC and TP hope that the launch of the Singapore Ride Safe 2020 will serve as a timely reminder to motorcyclists to stay safe and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from potential accidents on the roads.

### Road Safety for The Elderly Campaign 2020


The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and People’s Association (PA), launched the Road Safety for the Elderly 2020 campaign on 28 August 2020.

Accidents involving elderly pedestrians remain a key concern. In the first half of 2020, about 46% of all accidents involving elderly pedestrians were attributed to jaywalking.

In past years, road safety engagements, carnivals and concerts were organised by SRSC and TP to reach out to the elderlies. These outreach efforts were complemented by LTA’s elderly-friendly traffic schemes such as the Green Man + reader mounted above the standard push-button at various signalised pedestrian crossings whereby elderlies may tap their senior citizen concession cards on the reader for longer crossing times. In addition, 50 Silver Zones will be implemented island-wide by 2023 to enhance road safety. Under this scheme, traffic-calming measures and senior-friendly road safety features are implemented at areas with a high proportion of elderly residents and where there have been past accidents involving seniors to remind motorists to slow down and look out for them.

This year, a road safety video titled ‘Life is Precious. Stay Safe’, has been produced to raise general road safety awareness amongst the elderly and their families on safe habits when crossing the road. The video, which was uploaded on SRSC’s Facebook and YouTube channel on 28 August 2020, aims to bring across the importance of road safety as well as to remind the elderly to be more vigilant on the roads, and to always make use of pedestrian crossings.

TP and SRSC are also collaborating with People’s Association to distribute hand sanitisers and wet wipes bearing road safety reminders to the elderly at some of the Community Clubs in areas with higher proportion of senior residents.

SRSC and TP will continue to educate and remind the elderly to stay safe on the roads for the well-being of themselves and their families.

### Singapore Road Safety Month (SRSM) 2020

![](/images/20200601_OTHERS_LAUNCH_OF_SINGAPORE_ROAD_SAFETY_MONTH_2.png)

 The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Ministry of Education (MOE), People’s Association (PA) and Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS), launched the Singapore Road Safety Month (SRSM) 2020 online campaign on 2 June 2020.

In its eighth year, the theme of the month-long campaign is “Road Safety for All”, and focus on raising awareness on road safety and encouraging road users to play their part in keeping the roads safe. During the campaign, posters and banners were displayed on trains, bus shelters and lampposts in the heartlands and vicinity of schools to remind the road users on good road safety practices.

In addition, this will be the first time that such banners will be displayed in residential estates within Bukit Timah to raise road safety awareness. Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Communications and Information and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Ms Sim Ann said "We strongly believe that our road safety campaign needs to move from arterial roads into residential estates, and I am glad SRSC is ready to do so. Driving in residential estates requires no less caution and care than driving on main roads - in fact, more caution and care is needed, because drivers need to look out for pedestrians, especially children and seniors. Let's make safe driving second nature in residential neighbourhoods."

A Road Safety Art Competition, supported by the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), was organised in March 2020 as part of SRSM 2020, with two categories: Schools and Open, to raise road safety awareness. The entries were judged based on their relevance, originality, creativity, and road safety messages conveyed. The artwork of the first prize winners were printed on EZ-Link cards for distribution.

We would also like to remind the public to stay safe on the roads and to remain safe during this COVID-19 period.
