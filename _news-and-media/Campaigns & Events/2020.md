The Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2020 was launched virtually on 23 December 2020 by the Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC). Associate Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, was the guest of honour.

The campaign is part of TP’s outreach efforts during the festive season to remind motorists that drink-driving is irresponsible and put themselves and other road users in danger. This year’s campaign tagline, “Drink or Drive, You Decide”, aims to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink.

As part of the campaign efforts, a short animation video will be uploaded on the Use Your RoadSense Facebook page on 24 December 2020. Road Safety leaflets and face masks with the tagline printed on it, will be distributed to motorists.

In collaboration with the Land Transport Authority, the campaign messages will also be displayed on the electronic boards along expressways and major roads, to remind motorists not to drink and drive.

Drink-driving is a serious offence. While the number of drink-driving cases has decreased in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period last year, the number of drink-driving accidents resulting in fatalities has increased. TP will continue to take tough enforcement actions against motorists who choose to drink and drive. Road safety is a shared responsibility, we should remind our friends and family to leave their vehicles at home if they intend to drink. TP urges all motorists to play their part and adopt good road sense to make Singapore roads safer for everyone.

Singapore Ride Safe (SRS) 2020
==================
The Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and the Traffic Police (TP), with support from the Land Transport Authority (LTA), launched the Singapore Ride Safe 2020 on 23 October 2020.

Accidents involving motorcyclists remain a key concern as they continue to account for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting in injuries or death. In the first half of 2020, motorcyclists or pillion riders were involved in about 60% of overall traffic accidents, and made up about 60% of overall traffic fatalities.

This year, a road safety video titled, ‘Be Safe For Your Loved Ones’, has been produced to remind motorcyclists to ride safely so that they can return home safely to their loved ones. The video, which was uploaded on SRSC’s Facebook, YouTube and Instagram on 23 October 2020, aims to encourage motorcyclists to don protective riding gear, stay out of blind spots of larger vehicles, and slow down as they approach, and while manoeuvring at road bends or corners.

The “Reward the Rider” initiative was also introduced in conjunction with Singapore Ride Safe 2020 on 23 October 2020 for a period of one month. Motorcyclists who are spotted by TP patrol officers wearing protective riding gear and practising good road sense and riding behaviour, were rewarded with road safety collaterals.

To widen outreach efforts, road safety tips for motorcyclists will also be shared over the air through radio station GOLD 90.5FM during the morning programme, LIVE! With Mike, Vernetta & Gurmit, from Monday, 26 October 2020 to Saturday, 31 October 2020. Audiences who take part in the contests and games during the programme, won prizes sponsored by Harley Davidson.

SRSC and TP hope that the launch of the Singapore Ride Safe 2020 will serve as a timely reminder to motorcyclists to stay safe and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from potential accidents on the roads.
