<p>The Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2024 was launched by Associate Professor
Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and
Ministry of National Development, on 28 November 2024 at the Fountain Square,
Clarke Quay. The event was organised by the Traffic Police (TP) with support
from the Singapore Road Safety Council, Singapore Nightlife Business Association,
and Singapore River One. This annual campaign reminds motorists of the
importance of making responsible choices, by not driving after drinking,
to ensure road safety for all road users. In his speech, MOS Faishal highlighted
that nine lives were lost due to drink driving accidents in the first half
of 2024.</p>

</div>
<p>
<br>This year's campaign also highlights TP's close collaboration with business
associations, which represent around 600 food and beverage, entertainment,
and nightlife outlets in Singapore. They have an important role in promoting
responsible drinking and anti-drink drive messages. For instance, a ground-up
initiative titled "Sober vs Drink Driving", led by an alcohol distributor
in partnership with a local hospitality group, demonstrated the effects
of alcohol on driving reflexes through interactive physical and digital
games. In addition, the first 6,000 unique players received a private hire
transport voucher, which could be used for a safe ride home. This initiative
is just one of many examples of how businesses and community partners are
playing an active role in reinforcing the anti-drink drive message.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>At the event, TP premiered an emotive road safety video titled "If you
drink, don't drive," illustrating the irreversible consequences of impaired
driving. To keep up public education, the video will be screened on various
outdoor media platforms, such as digital billboards, bus stops and lift
lobbies, as well as social media platforms. TP has also collaborated with
The Smart Local and SGAG to produce creative content that will share anti
drink-driving messages. These are scheduled for launch in December 2024.
In addition to visual reminders, anti-drink driving messages will be broadcasted
on Class 95 FM and 933 FM to remind motorists not to drink and drive.</p>

</div>
<p>
<br>TP will also continue to work with the Land Transport Authority to display
anti-drink drive messages on electronic boards along expressways and main
roads to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink.
<br>
</p>
<p>As the festive season approaches, TP advises merrymakers to plan their
journeys home before consuming their first drink. Whether it is a taxi,
private hire car, bus, train, valet service, or a designated sober driver,
TP urges everyone to prioritise safety and get home safely.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>TP and partners wish everyone a safe and joyous festive season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The STG is an annual inter-school event that teaches primary school children
good road safety practices and etiquette through practical sessions. Participants
take on the roles of pedestrians, cyclists, and go-kart drivers, to instil
important road safety habits and prepare them to be responsible road users
as they grow up. Since its inception in 1958, the STG has been a cherished
rite of passage for many generations of school children.</p>

<p><strong>Premier of Road Safety Video on Children Safety</strong>
</p>
<p>During the event, TP premiered a new road safety video highlighting the
potential dangers of unsupervised children near busy roads. The video depicts
a serious accident involving a student who runs onto the road between parked
cars, resulting in an accident with an oncoming vehicle. The video serves
as a stark reminder to family members, guardians, teachers and caregivers,
to always supervise children near busy roads, and teach them about the
dangers of crossing between parked vehicles without supervision.</p>

<p>TP remains committed to enhancing road safety, especially for children.
While TP continues our educational and engagement efforts with our stakeholders
and partners, we would like to remind all road users that road safety is
a shared responsibility. Let's work together to create a safer road environment
by driving and riding responsibly, as well as setting a good example for
our young ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A significant moment of the event was the unveiling of the new Road Safety
Jingle, which aims to remind all road users about the importance of safety
and the necessity of gracious behavior on the roads. This jingle encourages
motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians alike to practice patience and consideration,
reinforcing the idea that road safety is a shared responsibility.</p>

<p>During the event, SRSC emphasized that road safety cannot be achieved
solely through enforcement by authorities. Each individual has a role to
play in ensuring that roads are safe for everyone. The council called on
all road users to remain vigilant and responsible, highlighting the importance
of returning home safely.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SRSC_Golf___Dinner_2024_4.jpg">
</div>
<p>In response to concerns raised on social media about traffic accidents
involving children, SRSC announced the establishment of a Road Safety Taskforce.
This taskforce aims to raise awareness and address these concerns by sharing
timely advisories through social media platforms and physical displays,
such as banners. By fostering a culture of safety, the taskforce will work
to promote responsible behavior among caregivers and their children.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Automobile Association of Singapore shared its plans
to develop a comprehensive Road Safety Playbook, supported by various government
agencies, including SRSC, TP, LTA, and MOE. This playbook will compile
updated information and guidelines specifically tailored for caregivers
and children, serving as a valuable resource to ensure that everyone understands
the importance of road safety.</p>
<p>As a gesture of appreciation, tokens of recognition were presented to
the donors during the event, highlighting SRSC's gratitude for their unwavering
support over the years. Their contributions are essential to the council's
mission of advancing road safety initiatives in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Ride Safe (SRS) 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>On 19 October 2024, in conjunction with the National Bikers’ Weekend (NBW)
2024, the Traffic Police (TP) and Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC),
with the support of Land Transport Authority (LTA), launched the Singapore
Ride Safe (SRS) campaign at Changi Exhibition Centre. Assoc Prof Muhammad
Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry
of National Development, was the Guest of Honour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SRS_2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Accidents involving motorcyclists remain a key concern as they continue
to account for a disproportionate number of traffic accidents resulting
in injuries or death. In the first half of 2024, motorcyclists and pillion
riders were involved in 54.5% of all traffic accidents and made up 61.6%
of all traffic fatalities.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The SRS 2024 campaign is part of TP’s ongoing efforts to engage the motorcyclist
community. It comprised two segments:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>1 April to 30 September 2024 – “Reward the Sensible Motorists” 2024; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18 to 20 October 2024, SRS 2024 at the NBW, Changi Exhibition Centre</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reward the Sensible Motorists 2024</strong>
<br>
<br>On 1 April 2024, TP launched the “Reward the Sensible Motorists” campaign,
where TP recognised motorists who practise safe riding and driving habits.
This includes actions like signalling before changing lanes and giving
way to other motorists and pedestrians. When TP officers spot these good
behaviours, they will reward the motorists with goodie bags and feature
them on the TP’s “Use Your RoadSense” Facebook page. The campaign highlights
that motorcyclists and drivers play an important role in keeping the roads
safe for all by adopting good riding and driving habits.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SRS_2024_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>From 1 April to 30 September 2024, a total of 82 motorists were commended
by TP. Amongst the 82, some exemplary motorists were presented with a special
award sponsored by Harley Davidson during SRS 2024.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>MOS Faishal said, “This year’s Singapore Ride Safe campaign carries the
tagline – “Gear Up, Ride Safe. Your loved ones await.”. It serves as a
poignant reminder that our families and loved ones are waiting for us at
home. I urge all motorists to adopt a safety-first attitude and exercise
graciousness on the road, as our actions impact not only ourselves but
those around us. If everyone commits to this mindset, we can significantly
reduce accidents and create safer roads for all.”
<br>
<br><strong>Reviewed Safety Standards for Helmets to Ensure Safety of Motorists</strong>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Apart from the two road safety campaigns, TP also worked closely with
stakeholders and partners, and had recently reviewed the Singapore Standard
(SS9) for helmets. The review is aimed at aligning the SS9 with internationally
recognised standards and ensuring recency of the motorcycle helmet safety
standards in Singapore. This may potentially avail motorcyclists with a
wider variety of approved helmets.

<p>During the event, TP’s stakeholders and partners hosted a series of talks
and activities to encourage the motorcyclist community to take proactive
measures to keep themselves safe on the roads. TP also premiered a new
road safety video featuring a delivery rider who met with an accident while
rushing to make a delivery in the rain. This emotive video serves as a
timely reminder to all motorcyclists to prioritise their safety, ensuring
that they return home safely to their loved ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This video is part of a broader road safety video campaign launched by
TP earlier this year. Members of the public can view these videos during
evening primetime slots on free-to-air TV channels. Additionally, the videos
will be displayed on outdoor media platforms, including bus stops and HDB
lift lobbies. More videos in the series will be released soon.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>The Traffic Police (TP) and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) launched
the Singapore Road Safety Month (SRSM) 2024 campaign today. One of the
highlights of this year’s campaign is the two day “Carnival for Families”
at Toa Payoh HDB Hub Mall Atrium from 1 – 2 June 2024. The Guest-of-Honour
for the launch of this campaign was Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State,
Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment &amp; Ministry of Transport.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SRSM_2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>The theme for this year’s SRSM campaign is “Road Safety Begins with You
and Me”. The month-long campaign aims to highlight that all of us have
a part to play in making our roads safer. As inculcating gracious road
user behaviour begins from young, parents, grandparents and caregivers
are encouraged to be good role models for their children by adopting good
road safety habits. To promote the theme, road safety banners will be placed
at strategic locations with high footfall to remind members of the public
of their shared responsibility in road safety.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>To increase road safety awareness among road users, TP will also be publishing
a series of road safety videos. The first video was launched during the
event and encourages the elderly pedestrians to adopt good road use habits
for their safety, as this road user group continued to be over-represented
in accidents. This series of videos will subsequently be screened on various
platforms, such as free-to-air television and “Use Your RoadSense” Facebook
page.</p>
