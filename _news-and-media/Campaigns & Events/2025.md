<p>The Traffic Police (TP) and the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) launched
the Singapore Road Safety Month campaign on 31 May 2025. This year’s event
also marked the 10th anniversary of the “Use Your RoadSense” initiative.
This year, the annual Singapore Ride Safe event for motorcyclists has also
been integrated with Singapore Road Safety Month to streamline outreach
efforts. Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State (SMS), Ministry of Home Affairs

<br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA), together with SRSC, TP, and the Ministry
of Education, will also be piloting a new handheld “STOP” sign at seven
selected primary schools from 1 July 2025. Students may use the handheld
sign at pedestrian crossings to enhance their visibility to approaching
vehicles.</p>

<br>A highlight of this year’s event was the launch of a new mini road circuit
for children to learn and practice proper road crossing techniques in a
safe environment. This new initiative may be set up at future road safety
events in the community. The event also featured a new child safety talk
by healthcare professionals, alongside regular programmes and booths by

<p><strong>Singapore Ride Safe 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>As part of the integrated Singapore Ride Safe programme to encourage safe
riding habits among motorcyclists, TP and SRSC invited representatives
from our community partner, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, to educate motorcyclists
on trauma prevention through proper gear usage.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The “Reward the Sensible Motorists” initiative will also run from 1 June
to 31 August 2025. During this period, TP will identify and reward responsible
motorists who demonstrate good road safety habits - such as wearing appropriate
protective gear and signalling before changing lanes - with goodie bags.
This year’s initiative will also be extended to bus operators.
<br>
<br>The Singapore Road Safety Month is part of TP’s and SRSC’s ongoing engagement
and educational efforts to raise road safety awareness and encourage good
road behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Road Safety Day is the latest initiative by TP to engage the community
and promote good road safety practices and habits amongst them. It features
a variety of interactive and educational activities designed to engage
residents of all ages, including concerts, interactive demonstrations,
exhibitions, and family-friendly activities promoting safe road use. Visitors
are able to gain insights into road safety rules and practices from TP
and learn about proper personal mobility device usage from LTA; and explore
SBS Transit's educational bus display to understand bus drivers’ blind
spots. These hands-on experiences were designed to make road safety education
more engaging and accessible for the community. Over the next two years,
the Road Safety Day events will be held in various locations progressively,
to reach out to the community and further promote awareness of road safety.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of community involvement in road safety</strong>
</p>
<p>To amplify road safety public education and outreach efforts, the SRSC
is collaborating with public and private stakeholders, including the Automobile
Association of Singapore, TP, LTA, and the Ministry of Education to increase
public awareness on road safety habits through the formation of the Road
Safety Outreach Taskforce. Some planned initiatives include the production
and distribution of road safety banners to all constituencies to spread
road safety awareness at the grassroots level, and the use of social media
channels to reinforce road safety messages.</p>
