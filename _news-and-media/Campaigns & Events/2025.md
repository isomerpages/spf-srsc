<p>The Road Safety Day is the latest initiative by TP to engage the community
and promote good road safety practices and habits amongst them. It features
a variety of interactive and educational activities designed to engage
residents of all ages, including concerts, interactive demonstrations,
exhibitions, and family-friendly activities promoting safe road use. Visitors
are able to gain insights into road safety rules and practices from TP
and learn about proper personal mobility device usage from LTA; and explore
SBS Transit's educational bus display to understand bus drivers’ blind
spots. These hands-on experiences were designed to make road safety education
more engaging and accessible for the community. Over the next two years,
the Road Safety Day events will be held in various locations progressively,
to reach out to the community and further promote awareness of road safety.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of community involvement in road safety</strong>
</p>
<p>To amplify road safety public education and outreach efforts, the SRSC
is collaborating with public and private stakeholders, including the Automobile
Association of Singapore, TP, LTA, and the Ministry of Education to increase
public awareness on road safety habits through the formation of the Road
Safety Outreach Taskforce. Some planned initiatives include the production
and distribution of road safety banners to all constituencies to spread
road safety awareness at the grassroots level, and the use of social media
channels to reinforce road safety messages.</p>
