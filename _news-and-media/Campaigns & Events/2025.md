</div>
<p>The Anti-Drink Drive Campaign 2025, organised by the Traffic Police (TP)
with support from the Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), Singapore Nightlife
Business Association, Singapore River One, Foochow Coffee Restaurant &amp;
Bar Merchants Association and Motorist Pte Ltd, was launched on 21 November
2025 at the Fountain Square, Clarke Quay. Senior Minister of State (SMS),
Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp; Ministry of Home Affairs, Ms Sim Ann,

<p></p>
<p>The Anti-Drink Drive campaign is an annual initiative which brings together
key stakeholders to promote awareness about the dangers of drink driving
and encourage responsible behaviour on the roads. The campaign typically
runs during festive periods and includes community outreach and enforcement
operations.</p>
<p>At the launch event, interactive activity booths were set up to demonstrate
the dangers of drink driving. Guests and members of the public challenged
themselves with the "Fast Hands" game or tested their driving abilities
on a driving simulator while wearing vision-impairing goggles that simulate
alcohol impairment.</p>
<p><strong>New Anti-Drink Drive Visual and Initiatives</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ADD2.png">
</div>
<p>This year's campaign features a visual showing a man looking into a mirror,
but instead of seeing his own reflection, he sees his family smiling back
at him and encouraging him to get home safely. It reminds motorists of
their responsibility to their loved ones.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ADD_Key_Visual.jpg">
</div>
<p>The campaign visual will be adapted into formats suitable for both digital
and physical platforms throughout the festive months. Anti-drink driving
posters will be displayed on Police Messaging Boards from late November
2025 to reiterate the anti-drink drive message.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ADD_Poster.jpg">
</div>
<p>TP has also introduced several new initiatives. For example, mirror decals
with anti-drink driving messages will be affixed to mirrors or restrooms
in nightlife venues from December 2025. These decals aim to remind motorists
to make alternative transport arrangements to get home.</p>
<p>Leading up to the Lunar New Year celebrations in February 2026, red packets
featuring "Get Home Safely" and "Do Not Drink and Drive" messages will
be distributed to the public, spreading road safety messages.</p>
<p>As part of ongoing efforts to prevent drink driving, TP is also collaborating
with valet service providers for the first time to remind motorists that
they should not drive if they intend to consume alcohol. Motorists are
advised not to drive to drinking establishments. For those who have driven
to such venues, valet services provide an alternative to ensure both driver
and vehicle return home safely. Through this partnership, valet service
providers will reinforce the "Don't Drink and Drive" message and promote
responsible transport options.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcing the Anti-Drink Drive Message throughout the Festive Period</strong>
</p>
<p>To complement engagement and education efforts, TP will continue to conduct
roadblock operations during the festive season to deter and detect drink
drivers.</p>
<p>TP will also continue to work with the Land Transport Authority to display
anti-drink drive messages on electronic boards along expressways and main
roads to remind motorists not to drive if they intend to drink.</p>

<p>The Traffic Police (TP), Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC), and the
Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS), with support from the Ministry
of Education and Tote Board, held the grand finals of the Singapore Traffic
Games (STG) on 7 November 2025, at the Road Safety Community Park. Ms Sim
Ann, Senior Minister of State (SMS), Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp;

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/STG1.jpg">
</div>
<p>The STG is an annual inter-school event that instils good road safety
habits in primary school children through practical sessions. Participants
experience different roles as pedestrians, cyclists, and go-kart drivers,
learning essential road safety habits that will help them become responsible
road users. Established in 1958, the STG has continued its decades-long
efforts to shape the road safety awareness of countless primary school
students.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/STG6.jpg">
</div>
<p>A total of 21 primary schools participated in this year’s STG qualifying
rounds, which were held from 26 August to 22 September 2025, with 10 primary
schools progressing to the finals. First Toa Payoh Primary School emerged
as champion with the lowest number of demerit points, winning the STG Challenge
Trophy.

<p>
<br><strong>Road Safety Situation for Children<br></strong>
<br>Between January and September 2025, 197 children were injured in traffic
accidents. Recent incidents highlight the ongoing risks children face on
the roads – there were three separate traffic accidents involving children
in a single day on 23 July 2025, which involved children who had ignored
traffic signals and failed to use proper crossings whilst crossing the
roads.
<br>
<br><strong>New Initiatives to Strengthen Road Safety Education for Children</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/STG4.jpg">
</div>
<p><strong><br></strong>TP continues to enhance educational initiatives to
help children develop essential road safety skills from an early age. During
the event, TP announced several new initiatives to strengthen road safety
education across different age groups.
<br>
<br>At the preschool level, TP will be partnering with major preschools to
integrate road safety education into their curriculum. This will establish
a two-year foundation of safety awareness for pre-schoolers, before they
begin primary school.
<br>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/STG5.jpg">
</div>
<p>
<br>For primary schools, TP and SRSC will introduce "Road Safety Corners"
to selected schools starting next year. This initiative includes dedicated
learning spaces that will feature road safety advisories and zebra crossing
floor stickers, enabling teachers to conduct road safety education through
interactive scenarios throughout the school year. The initiative aims to
bring the Road Safety Community Park experience directly into the school
environment.
<br>
<br>Two educational materials have also been developed for primary school
students to complement the “Road Safety Corners”. A Traffic Police edition
of the Police Pal storybook series allows community policing officers to
engage students in road safety education during school visits. Additionally,
TP has developed an interactive game console to reinforce safe-crossing
habits through engaging questions and scenarios. The console will be deployed
during school visits and community events.</p>

<p>
<br>
<br><strong>Industry Support for Road Safety Education<br></strong>
<br>The collaborative efforts by TP, SRSC, educational institutions, families,
and sponsors demonstrates Singapore's dedication to road safety as a collective
community responsibility. The STG remains an important component of TP's
educational efforts, evolving to meet changing needs while preserving the
fundamental principles that have made it successful for nearly seven decades.</p>

</div>
<p>A key highlight of the evening was the launch of the SRSC Commendation
Award for SRSC’s Road Safety Heroes. The award encourages public-spiritedness
by recognising members of the public who display courage, graciousness
and responsibility in keeping Singapore’s roads safe.</p>
<p>The inaugural awards were presented to two bus captains from SMRT Corporation,
Bus Captain Yau Minddin Bin Muhamad and Senior Bus Captain Ngui Poh Seng,
who assisted a driver whose vehicle caught fire along Bukit Timah Road
on 17 August 2025.</p>
<p>As a gesture of appreciation, tokens of recognition were also presented
to the donors during the event, highlighting SRSC's gratitude for their
unwavering support over the years. Their contributions are essential to
the Council's mission of advancing road safety initiatives in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Gala1.jpg">
</div>
<p>SMS Sim Ann emphasised that road safety remains a shared responsibility.
She noted that the road traffic statistics were concerning, particularly
for vulnerable road users, but said that with stronger partnerships, continued
public support and individual responsibility, the trend can be reversed,
and the roads can be made safer for all.</p>

<p>The SRSA recognises organisations and individuals for their efforts in
putting in place systems and for working conscientiously towards enhancing
road safety. This year, a total of 38 awards were presented, including
13 Excellence Awards and 25 Merit Awards.</p>
<p>A new award category in collaboration with the Singapore Armed Forces
was also introduced, recognising Military Vehicle Drivers with Class 3
and Class 4 licences. This new initiative reflects a broader and more inclusive
approach to road safety and acknowledges the professionalism of our national
servicemen.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SRSA5.jpg">

<p>Held in conjunction with SRSA, the RSS brought together heavy vehicle
fleet owners to foster collaboration and exchange knowledge within the
industry. The seminar featured discussions on the latest developments in
road safety, including new government policies, emerging technologies,
and best practices in fleet management.</p>
<p>Participants of the RSS also heard from road safety authorities, industry
leaders, and past SRSA recipients, who shared valuable insights and experiences
on how businesses can enhance their road safety performance by leveraging
technology and adopting a proactive approach to fleet management and driver
safety.</p>

</div>
<p>During the presentation at the seminar, Superintendent of Police Lian
Weixiong, Head of Research, Planning and Organisational Development Branch,
TP, highlighted that lorries with a Maximum Laden Weight (MLW) of between
3,501kg and 12,000kg will be required to install speed limiters according
to the deadlines shown in Annex B.&nbsp; With the first deadline of 1 January
2026 approaching, TP strongly encourages companies to expedite the installation
of speed limiters to prevent costly penalties, avoid installation delays
due to limited workshop capacity, and contribute to road safety. Speed
limiters can also provide benefits such as fuel savings, lower maintenance
costs and lower downtime. Please refer to Singapore Police Force Website
for the list of authorised agents available in Singapore.</p>
<p>SRSC and its partners are committed to fostering industry engagement by
promoting road safety awareness through targeted outreach programmes like
the SRSA and RSS. SRSC and TP encourage more organisations to take part
in future editions of the SRSA to foster a strong culture of road safety
within workplaces and on Singapore’s roads.</p>
