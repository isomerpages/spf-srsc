SRSC  LOGO
==================

The primary element of this logo is represented by the use of a road within a safety triangle. The triangle reminds us to be cautious, and the symbol of the road is where activity evolves for all road users, be it pedestrian, motorists, cyclists and drivers alike.

The road veers and joins with the word ‘Road Safety’ to highlight the direction and the efforts of the Council.

Red is used to remind us to be alert and Orange is an international colour code for safety.
